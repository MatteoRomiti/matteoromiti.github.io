Thoughts and opinions I want to write down and share. <!--more-->

- Driving an electric car is like being vegan, somehow.

- Girls with curly hair makes me feel a bit nervous. Black curly hair even more.

- People that speak softly and at a regular pace are wise people, usually.

- Italian news talk way too much about politics.

- Owning a bidet is a necessary but not sufficient condition to be a developed society.

- Listening to people speaking English with a strong Indian accent is fantastic.

- People who live with little knowledge find happiness easily, but are more easily thrown off by the random vicissitudes of life. People who live with large knowledge find happiness with difficulty, but it is more stable and enduring when they find it.
