Thoughts and opinions I want to write down and share. <!--more-->

- If you want to make me happy, get me a fruit, a plant or a vegetable (artichokes excluded).

- OBI is my favorite shop.

- Girls with curly hair makes me feel a bit nervous. Black curly hair even more.

- People that speak softly and at a regular pace sound like wise people to me.

- Italian news talk way too much about politics.

- Owning a bidet is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to be a developed society.

- Listening to people speaking English with a strong Indian accent is fantastic.

- Driving an electric car is like being vegan, somehow.

- People who live with little knowledge find happiness easily, but are more easily thrown off by the random vicissitudes of life. People who live with large knowledge find happiness with difficulty, but it is more stable and enduring when they find it.
