I guess some people developed some kind of hobby during these covid-19 lockdowns<!--more-->, making pizza, jogging, and so on. I instead got interested in plants.

Some months ago I moved into a new flat and it was clear that walls, shelves, windows were waiting for some green, some life, some colors and thanks to some subreddits like 
[r/plants](https://www.reddit.com/r/plants),
[r/houseplants](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplants),
[r/plantclinic](https://www.reddit.com/r/plantclinic),
[r/proplifting](https://www.reddit.com/r/proplifting),
[r/whatsthisplant](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant),
[r/rareplants](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareplants)
I was able to get into the plant's world a bit.

Below is the result at the time of this writing, more or less. If you want to read the names in the picture, you find the full image [here](https://github.com/MatteoRomiti/matteoromiti.github.io/blob/master/images/all_plants.jpg).

![Almost all the plants I had](/images/all_plants.jpg)

In alphabetical order based on the plant's name from left to right and in chronological order based on when the plant entered the flat from the top to the bottom of the column.

I have to admit that some of them did not make it, while some others were gifted to friends and family members or swapped with other plants.

If you happen to be interested in plants, swapping or receiving or taking care of them, let me know!
